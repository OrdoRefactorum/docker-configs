# docker-configs

## Intro

I tinker a lot with different applications and ideas. Whenever possible I use docker containers for these excursions so I can quickly spin up an environment and tear it down when no longer needed.

## Info

As of creation of this repository I have been working with docker version **27.3.1**.
Keep this in mind when trying to run one of the compose files.

Empty folders with just a **.gitkeep** file in them are meant for when you want to access an app from outside for one reason or another.
